## üìö Description

This project introduces the concept of **functions** and **nested loops** in the C programming language. You will learn how to use loops within loops, define and declare your own functions, and organize your code using header files and function prototypes. This foundational knowledge is essential for writing clean, modular, and reusable C code.
