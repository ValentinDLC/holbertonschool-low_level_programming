# C - Function Pointers

## Project by: Valentin Dardenne 
**Weight**: 1  
**Track**: Low-Level Programming / C  

---

## 📚 Description

This project introduces **function pointers** in C — a powerful feature used to pass functions as arguments, implement callbacks, and create flexible and dynamic behavior in programs.  

You will:
- Understand what a function pointer actually holds
- Learn how function pointers work in memory
- Use them to manipulate arrays and build a simple calculator

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without external help:

- ✅ What are function pointers and how to use them
- ✅ What does a function pointer hold in memory
- ✅ How function pointers are located in virtual memory
- ✅ How to use function pointers to build flexible programs
- ✅ Why and when to use function pointers (callbacks, plug-in architectures...)

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Editor**: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` only
- **Compilation**:  
  ```bash
  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
