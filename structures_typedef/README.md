## Author

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the usage of **structures** and **typedef** in the C programming language.  
It aims to help you understand when and how to use structures to group related data and how `typedef` can improve code readability.

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:
- What are structures in C
- When and why to use structures
- How to define and use `typedef` in C

---

## Requirements
- **Allowed editors:** `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using:  
  `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Each file must end with a **new line**
- A `README.md` file is mandatory
- Code must follow **Betty style**
- **Global variables are not allowed**
- **Maximum 5 functions per file**
- Only the following C standard library functions are allowed: `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `exit`
- You are not required to push the `main.c` files; they are provided for testing
- All header files must be **include guarded**
